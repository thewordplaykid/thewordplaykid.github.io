		  My original prediction that Biden might win seems to have been correct. Unfortunately, the hardest part we have yet to face going on is defending the "sore loser" from making any of those dreaded accusations of voter fraud. Although we know the answer is pretty much final, Trump still resorts to his grand old lie tactics as he always does. I'd suppose he's trying to steal the victory for himself by coming up with these claims, such as, if I had to write an example, "Have you people lost your minds? I have claimed victory! Just forget what that College is doing with those absentee and fake ballots, must I remind you that when we recount and dispose of the invalid amounts, I really will have won!"

		  I, an anagram creator in my free time, might discover his rejection of current reality and develop a prompt response to him which shall stand like this, "Well, we haven't lost our divided minds. You have, though! Why? The pandemic! A calamity is of suffering, statistics, and a long race to make standard vaccines. We understand every aspect we used, highlighting what has to be done, but you still follow some other topic, leaving the dirty work to the rest of us. If there were complaints shown about it, selfish you would have tossed them all aside to rather express something completely different: staying in office. But then again, you won't, as I figure that somebody shall soon want to replace you."

		  [A four-way mathematical word length constraint anagram in the vein of Mike Keith's Pictographie. As Keith suggested per the rules he set for Pictographie, "...the next longest text of this kind would have 416 letters in each part, which would represent the first 76 digits of pi, the first 73 digits of e, and the first 72 digits of phi. Amazingly, the first 72 digits of tau, or 2pi, also require 416 letters, so in this case a four-way text would be possible." And that is exactly where it started. Each section follows the digits individually except for two adjacent 1s, representing words of length 11.]

		  Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won. The proof is irrefutable! Massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states, stuffing the ballot boxes (on video), double voters, dead voters, fake signatures, illegal immigrant voters, banned Republican vote watchers, MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS (check out Detroit and Philadelphia), and much more. The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states, and cannot even be contested. Courts are bad, the FBI and "Justice" didn't do their job, and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country. Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time, it is Fake News, and now we have Big Tech (with Section Two Hundred Thirty) to deal with. But when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country's history, WE WILL WIN!!!

		  Doesn't it make poor Trump look like the loser for him to blame what struggles he denied to accept? Allow me to write this in all caps: BIDEN WON FAIR GAME. TRUMP CANNOT BRIBE THE MINDS OF CROWDS SO DISTURBED, FOR THEY'VE TURNED HIM AWAY. At least give more than lies when we expect answers of a leader! Bring facts, not this insignificant fraud claim, as it's nothing short of lies! The objective of a leader is to represent the country, not devastate it sick (as if we weren't already that way, thanks COVID, that fatal stress)! Are we just plentiful? No, the USA stands on a brink as a dumb idiot tells it so. Unforgivable, unbelievable! COVID circumstances will not be gone overnight. Hint: Begin a big large effort and provide research, then echo this topic to us! We indeed did our job, Trump. You, on the other hand, didn't do yours in return, and that was to be chill, demonstrate the silence you deserved, and shut the hell up. That's why we didn't vote for you.
