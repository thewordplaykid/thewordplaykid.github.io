					My original prediction that Biden might win seems to have been correct. Unfortunately, the hardest part we have yet to face going on is defending the "sore loser" from making any of those dreaded accusations of voter fraud. Although we know the answer is pretty much final, Trump still resorts to his grand old lie tactics as he always does. I'd suppose he's trying to steal the victory for himself by coming up with these claims, such as, if I had to write an example, "Have you people lost your minds? I have claimed victory! Just forget what that College is doing with those absentee and fake ballots, must I remind you that when we recount and dispose of the invalid amounts, I really will have won!"

					I, an anagram creator in my free time, might discover his rejection of current reality and develop a prompt response to him which shall stand like this, "Well, we haven't lost our divided minds. You have, though! Why? The pandemic! A calamity is of suffering, statistics, and a long race to make standard vaccines. We understand every aspect we used, highlighting what has to be done, but you still follow some other topic, leaving the dirty work to the rest of us. If there were complaints shown about it, selfish you would have tossed them all aside to rather express something completely different: staying in office. But then again, you won't, as I figure that somebody shall soon want to replace you."

					[A four-way mathematical word length constraint anagram in the vein of Mike Keith's "Pictographie". As Keith suggested per the rules he set, "...the next longest text of this kind would have 416 letters in each part, which would represent the first 76 digits of pi, the first 73 digits of e, and the first 72 digits of phi. Amazingly, the first 72 digits of tau, or 2pi, also require 416 letters, so in this case a four-way text would be possible." And that is exactly where it started. Each section follows the digits individually except for two adjacent 1s, representing words of length 11.]

					Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency, like the Democrats would do if they had actually won. The proof is irrefutable! Massive late night mail-in ballot drops in swing states, stuffing the ballot boxes (on video), double voters, dead voters, fake signatures, illegal immigrant voters, banned Republican vote watchers, MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS (check out Detroit and Philadelphia), and much more. The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states, and cannot even be contested. Courts are bad, the FBI and "Justice" didn't do their job, and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country. Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time, it is Fake News, and now we have Big Tech (with Section Two Hundred Thirty) to deal with. But when it is all over, and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Country's history, WE WILL WIN!!!

					Doesn't it make poor Trump look like the loser for him to blame what struggles he denied to accept? Allow me to write this in all caps: BIDEN WON FAIR GAME. TRUMP CANNOT BRIBE THE MINDS OF CROWDS SO DISTURBED, FOR THEY'VE TURNED HIM AWAY. At least give more than lies when we expect answers of a leader! Bring facts, not this insignificant fraud claim, as it's nothing short of lies! The objective of a leader is to represent the country, not devastate it sick (as if we weren't already that way, thanks COVID, that fatal stress)! Are we just plentiful? No, the USA stands on a brink as a dumb idiot tells it so. Unforgivable, unbelievable! COVID circumstances will not be gone overnight. Hint: Begin a big large effort and provide research, then echo this topic to us! We indeed did our job, Trump. You, on the other hand, didn't do yours in return, and that was to be chill, demonstrate the silence you deserved, and shut the hell up. That's why we didn't vote for you.

					<b>The Lady who Knows Everything</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					An old tale tells of a lady who wanders Earth.
					<br>
					The Lady who Knows Everything.
					<br>
					A beautiful lady who has found every answer,
					<br>
					All meaning,
					<br>
					All purpose,
					<br>
					And all that was ever sought.
					<br>
					<br>
					And here I am,
					<br>
					<br>
					a feather
					<br>
					<br>
					Lost adrift the sky, victim of the currents of the wind.
					<br>
					<br>
					Day after day, I search.
					<br>
					I search with little hope, knowing legends don't exist.
					<br>
					But when all else has failed me,
					<br>
					When all others have turned away,
					<br>
					The legend is all that remains - the last dim star glimmering in the twilit sky.
					<br>
					<br>
					Until one day, the wind ceases to blow.
					<br>
					I fall.
					<br>
					And I fall and fall, and fall even more.
					<br>
					Gentle as a feather.
					<br>
					A dry quill, expressionless.
					<br>
					<br>
					But a hand catches me, between the thumb and forefinger.
					<br>
					The hand of a beautiful lady.
					<br>
					I look at her eyes and find no end to her gaze.
					<br>
					<br>
					The Lady who Knows Everything knows what I am thinking.
					<br>
					Before I can speak, she responds in a hollow voice.
					<br>
					"I have found every answer, all of which amount to nothing.
					<br>
					There is no meaning.
					<br>
					There is no purpose.
					<br>
					And we seek only the impossible.
					<br>
					I am not your legend.
					<br>
					Your legend does not exist."
					<br>
					<br>
					And with a breath, she blows me back afloat, and I pick up a gust of wind.

					<b>Unclaimed, Uninformed, Unearthed, Sent Off: A Brief Story</b>
					<br>
					<br>
					Even land where I had known,
					<br>
					Slowly down they blankly fall,
					<br>
					Walking out through hell unknown,
					<br>
					Walled in truth wrongly delayed.
					<br>
					What flaw of law shall translate
					<br>
					To expect knowledge or stall?
					<br>
					<br>
					Why have a said reasoning?
					<br>
					Problematic government!
					<br>
					Wealth halfway operating!
					<br>
					These fallacies we had heard,
					<br>
					Shameful, he shies per his word,
					<br>
					Told in the fear he emit.

					<br>
					News flash: "Avoid the Nineteen,
					<br>
					Mask stays on, I have you warned.
					<br>
					Valuable to quarantine.
					<br>
					Farewell to a close exchange,

					Keep two meters of his range."
					<br>
					Headline: "We Were Uninformed."
					<br>
					<br>
					Make a mistake, hell awaits!
					<br>
					How disappointing yet true,
					<br>
					Holding standards like two gates,
					<br>
					Healthy fools misdirected,
					<br>
					Thin bonds spread out, soon fated,
					<br>
					Claiming the two are both you.
					<br>
					<br>
					Seventy, eighty, ninety!
					<br>
					Abracadabra! Thousands!
					<br>
					Virus Nineteen fights mighty!
					<br>
					An animal infected,
					<br>
					Death counters that inflated,
					<br>
					Hope lies dry beneath hot sands.
					<br>
					<br>
					If someday yields safe living
					<br>
					(Likelihood high, rules followed)
					<br>
					And vast business back blazing,
					<br>
					Hardly have we kept our health,
					<br>
					Example not on the shelf
					<br>
					With then any rain erode.
